# Autoregression



# Galgraphs
Here you will find a library of graphing functions. They run on pandas and matplot lib for best effect.

Graphs with ax take a axis from matplotlib.
Use pattern matplotlib 'fig, ax = subplots(1,1)' for best effect.

Graphs without an 'ax' input plot themselves.



The code used here HEAVILY relies upon the foundational work of Matt Drury.
It is repurposed for much more
