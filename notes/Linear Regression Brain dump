Linear Regression Brain dump



so whats the problem here:


i can't keep my testing envirmeonts straight.

why?
I keep gettting confused what's calling what in notebooks, and what I was working on specifically.

I get lost in my code.

sS what do I need to do?

1) Test make_linear_graphs by itself. On clean data?

2) OR go grab copies of the other work.

3) Find a way to make similar environments

	A) Make the ridge/linear_maker consistant

	B) Make a totally fresh jupyter testing environment. (That's somehow similar???)

	C) make a universally consistant tester???

PROBLEM:
	EACH REGRESSION NEEDS TO RETURN A PIPELINE OR NOT
	LINEAR REGRESSION NEEDS TO RETURN A PIPELINE THAT REMOVES ALL CONT. VARIABLES *OR* I need to find another method. 

	IS K FOLDS RIDGE TOO CONFUSING BY MAKING A PIPELINE??? I dont THINK so? hard to say at this point. 

	Because each method uses different cleaning methods, they should just intake df_test (which is df_X_test, in this current case) 

	interesting, there are different senarios. Sometimes the X_test is given, sometimes it isn't. 
	We can do a Kfold, which is, in many ways, more effective, but somehow not proving enough for me right now. 
	so the ideal here, then is to make the option to add a separate X_test and/or Y_test. AND if not to automatically make the test and compare it.
	And then have it output the trainings residuals
